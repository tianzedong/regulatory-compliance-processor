# Regulatory Compliance Document Processor
<!-- overview, objectives, project setup and technologies, testing, help, bonus, evaluation, good luck -->
## Overview

This project is a coding assignment for our startup focused on regulatory compliance. The goal is to build a tool that processes a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document along with multiple regulatory documents. The tool should:

- **Extract all regulatory clauses** from each regulatory document.
- **Find the clauses that are relevant to the SOP**
- **Determine and suggest adjustments** for the SOP based on the extracted regulatory requirements.
  
There is no one “right” solution. We’re interested in how you design the solution, structure your code, and document your approach.

## Objectives

- **Input:** 
  - One SOP document (`data/sop.pdf`)
  - 10–20 regulatory documents in the `data/regulatory_docs/` directory. Note: We have provided 10 for you to get started.
- **Functionality:**
  - Load and parse the SOP and regulatory documents.
  - Identify and extract regulatory clauses from the regulatory documents.
  - Apply relevant clauses to analyze the SOP document.

- **Output:**
  - A report or log that details the regulatory compliance analysis, highlighting any discrepancies between the SOP and the regulatory requirements.
  - (Optional but preferred) Provide a web interface for the internal dev team to interact with the tool.

## Project Setup and Technologies

- **Project Setup:**
  - Use any programming language of your choice (Python is preferred).
  - Write clean, and modular code.

- **Technologies:**
  - Semantic Search
  - Vector DBs
  - LLMs
  - QA Models
  - Langchain
  - python-docx

None of the above technologies are required. Feel free to use any other technologies you want.

## Help

If you want help/guidance, please reach out to me: aaryan@getinterface.ai

Remember, **this is YOUR code**
  - Do whatever you want with the code
  - Make it work
  - Aim for accuracy over speed
  - Aim for scalability and maintainability

## Good Luck!
We're excited to see your implementation that balances technical prowess with elegant regulatory compliance skills. Happy coding!
